Story:

You awaken within a mysterious complex.

As you make your way through the rooms, you eventually find a machine. Interacting with it allows you to shift your stats around.

Eventually, you discover that the whole "complex" is a crashed spaceship.

You complete some puzzles and power the spaceship up.

The game now allows FTL-like travel between planets.
